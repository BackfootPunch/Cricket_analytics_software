# 🏏 Cricket Analytics Software - The Hundred 2025

A comprehensive cricket analytics system for The Hundred tournament featuring data scraping, team strength analysis, match predictions, tournament simulation, and an interactive dashboard.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the complete analytics system:

```bash
python run_analytics.py
```

This will:
1. Set up all data files from provided schedules and squads
2. Generate venue and player statistics
3. Calculate team strength ratings
4. Run tournament simulations (1000 iterations)
5. Launch the interactive dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8050

## 📊 System Components

### 1. Data Collection (`scrapers/`)
- **Venue Scraper**: Generates realistic venue statistics based on historical T20 patterns
- **Player Scraper**: Creates player performance data with batting/bowling splits
- **Output**: `venue_stats.csv`, `player_stats.csv`

### 2. Team Strength Calculator (`team_strength_calculator.py`)
- **Batting Strength**: AVG(top 5 batters) × (historical run rate/10)
- **Bowling Strength**: (10 - AVG(top 5 bowlers' economy)) × 2
- **Output**: `team_ratings.csv`, radar comparison plots

### 3. Match Analyzer (`match_analyzer.py`)
- Takes match ID, toss winner, and toss decision
- Calculates win probabilities using team ratings and venue factors
- Applies 15% toss advantage for optimal decisions
- Returns detailed analysis with key factors and player insights

### 4. Tournament Simulator (`tournament_simulator.py`)
- Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations)
- Applies venue biases and optimal toss decisions
- Generates playoff and winner probabilities
- **Output**: `tournament_predictions.csv`, `tournament_analysis.csv`

### 5. Interactive Dashboard (`hundred_analytics_dash.py`)
- **Match Analyzer**: Select matches, set toss conditions, view probabilities
- **Tournament Overview**: Win probability charts, team comparisons
- **Venue Analysis**: Impact visualization, player matchup heatmaps
- **Team Radar Charts**: Multi-dimensional team strength comparison
